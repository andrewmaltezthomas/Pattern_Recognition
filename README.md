# Pattern Recognition
Python and R codes used for the pattern recognition discipline @ USP using microarray RNA expression data obtained from breast cancer patients that had mutations in the BRACA1 or the BRACA2 genes. 

#### Available codes for linearly separable binary classifications:
* Linear Regression: Mean Square Error (MSE) classifier
* Finding linearly separable gene pairs using linear programming constraint solvers
* Support vector machines: Maximum margin 
* Support vector machines: Soft margin
* Support vector machines: Soft margin with bolstered error estimation
